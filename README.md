# Gland Executor Loader

A proof-of-concept desktop launcher that displays the Meta Horizon World GUI loader
for the Gland Executor project. The code currently provides a Tkinter window with
placeholder controls that you can later wire to real injection logic.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+

## Usage
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
python main.py
```

The window is intentionally simple and non-functional so you can integrate it with
the actual Meta Horizon Worlds injection workflow as the project evolves.
